3. Introduction: <br />
  Hello, My name is Nicholas Limbach and i am currently in my third year at the Univeristy of Akron for my major in Computer Science. I like to spend my free time      messing around in the unity game engine as well as exploring code and hanging out with friends. I plan to graduate in 2025 and while I dont have anything exactly planned after my graduation, I do want to find a job doing something with coding and if preferable with the Unity engine (Although I think I will want more experince with it).
  
4. There is two listed contributors. Why? <br />
nl1213 is a private personal account that I forgot to unlink from my github interface on my home PC. This account has projects that are private properity and therefore I cannot showcase them here.
