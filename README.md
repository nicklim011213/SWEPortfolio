## Github Protfollio + Resume

Hello, and welcome to my repository. This repository contains a few files and a will breifly list them here.

1. Protofolio projects - This is a folder which contains multiple sub folders of project ive have worked on. Some are ready to go and others require software to setup and use. All my code for any games will be found under the Asset folder of said game. I have included 2 unity games and a C# Project for the Stockmarket.

The first game is called Platform Bais refering to the platforms in said game being weigh or baised aginst or for you. The concept is simple you start on a platofrm and must work your way down to the end. The stipulation being if you fall to fast you will fail to break your fall and lose. Platforms have different colors to indicate different properties and some simple game logic scripting was done for level control etc... This is my first project in Unity game engine and was created in my spare time durring highschool.

The second game is called Steampunker and is a game about managing steam using pipes to automate tasks. The game is more complex than the previous and makes use of reading objects attached to eachother in screenspace. The big idea is that the steam flows in pipes and empties each pipe and pushes it all to the next one. This happens over and over again until it reachs whatever uses it. This was created in my spare time a few years ago. Both games were never finished.

The stock trading bot is the last thing you will find in the portfolio. This bot connects to an API provided for free (in which I had to remove my API key) and has serval important functions which help predict which stocks investors should buy into. When enetering the program you will be greated by a console who will ask for a ticker name or command. If a command is found it will execute it. Update will automaticly update a list of around 100 tickers set in an array and then send it to a file. Typing exit will exit the program. Typing calculate will do some basic math and attempt to predcit which stocks are going to increase in price. The calculate command has blocks of commented code called modules. These can be commented or uncommnented at will to change how it estimates. Finally typing a valid ticker will call the API to ask for historical data. If the ticker already exists in its file it wall ask if you want to update it rather than write over it.

2. You can also find my Resume at the root in a pdf File format. It contains skills, awards, and other important details.

3. Introduction: <br />
  Hello, My name is Nicholas Limbach and i am currently in my third year at the Univeristy of Akron for my major in Computer Science. I like to spend my free time      messing around in the unity game engine as well as exploring code and hanging out with friends. I plan to graduate in 2025 and while I dont have anything exactly planned after my graduation, I do want to find a job doing something with coding and if preferable with the Unity engine (Although I think I will want more experince with it).
  
4. There is two listed contributors. Why? <br />
nl1213 is a private personal account that I forgot to unlink from my github interface on my home PC. This account has projects that are private properity and therefore I cannot showcase them here.
