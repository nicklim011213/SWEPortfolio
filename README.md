  Hello, My name is Nicholas Limbach and i am currently in my third year at the Univeristy of Akron for my major in Computer Science. I like to spend my free time      messing around in the unity game engine as well as exploring code and hanging out with friends. I plan to graduate in 2025 and while I dont have anything exactly planned after my graduation, I do want to find a job doing something with coding and if preferable with the Unity engine (Although I think I will want more experince with it).
